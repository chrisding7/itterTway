# itterTway

## Introduction 
A Twitter-like web app but in pig Latin.



## Functionality

### Login page
Upon loading all users will be directed to the login page where you can login or sign up.

### Signup page
The user can create an account by providing a username, a display name, a password and a password comfirmation. Passwords are hashed.

### Home page
The home page has a text box for creating eeTways and lists all existing eeTways from all users.

### Profile page
The profile page displays the user's username, display name, bio (can be edited) and all posts by that user.



## Bugs and work to be done
There is no current way to reply to eeTways.
The pig Latin agorithm handles some punctuation imperfectly.



## Credits
Created by Chris Mann, Chris Ding and Justin Saborouh, based on standard React and Rails templates.
